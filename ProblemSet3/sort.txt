SORT

No file included because of the nature of the assignment.

Downloaded a file containing 
	- 3 sorting algorithms with no identifiers.
	- Text files of random, reversed, and sorted numbers of varying size.
	- An answer.txt file with questions in it.

Using a timer and the ability to sort the random, reversed, and sorted number files with one of the three algorithms at a time.

I had to identify which sorting algorithm was a Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Merge Sort based on the time complexities of each.


Selection Sort: Θ(n^2)
Bubble Sort: O(n^2), Ω(n)
Merge Sort: Θ(log n)
